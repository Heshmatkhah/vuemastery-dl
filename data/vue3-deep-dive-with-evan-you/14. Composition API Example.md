# Composition API Example

In this lesson we write some code to demonstrate the power of the Composition API.  Evan creates a reusable composition function called `useFetch` which does an API call. He also explains why he likes to use `ref`s over `reactive` in these functions, and shows how composition functions are able to encapsulate stateful logic that runs across the whole lifecycle of the component that is consuming it. Lastly, we discuss a few more use-cases for choosing composition API to create components.

## CORRECTION

Viewers of this video have noted that the code Evan shows doesn't seem to need to declare the prop `props: [ 'id']` in the component to work.  If you're following along you may need to add this to get the code working.  [See here](http://jsfiddle.net/7rbhz2pq) for a working example.
